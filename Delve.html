								<h2 class="major">What Is Delve</h2>
								<p>
                                    Delve is the product of a week-long game jam with a theme of deceptions designed in the Godot engine. 
                                    Because of the theme, my team and I decided to create a challenging platformer with hidden elements for the player to have to learn from previous deaths. 
                                    I was the designated lead and oversaw a group of 9 others to ensure a successful project by the end of the week. 
                                    The design of the project was to make a difficult platformer with some deceptive evidence to give the player a sense of doubt wherever they went in the level. 
                                    I was tasked with designing the mechanical aspects of most of the interactions that the player would have within the world.

                                <h2 class="major">What I Accomplished</h2>
								<ul>
									<li>Engineering lead overseeing 9 others to produce a successful product</li>
									<li>Created a collectable to act as something to encourage exploration</li>
									<li>Implemented multidirectional moving objects that can be freely altered by the level designer</li>
								</ul>
                                
                                <h2 class="major">Lessons Learned</h2>
								<p>
                                    One of the biggest things I had to learn was understanding how modular-style objects needed to funciton. 
                                    I had to discover a balance between a versatile object while also ensuring the editable properties stay simple and concise for the level designer to perform their job quickly and efficiently.
                                    This was the first project where I was in a leadership position and had to learn how to distribute appropriate tasks as well as keeping the game scope in relation to group size.
