								<h2 class="major">What Is PinBall</h2>
								<p>
                                    PinBall is a versus style pinball game that takes inspiration from air hockey while keeping the pinball feel. 
                                    The project was designed in the Unreal Engine utilizing Rider for a IDE along with Perforce for source control. 
                                    The members of the project consisted of me, the lead programmer, and one other who handled most of the art and the initial framework of the UI.
                                </p>
                                <h2 class="major">What Was The Goal</h2>
                                <p>
                                    The goal of the project was to get a decent grasp of how Unreal’s C++ coding worked along with learning how to easily integrate it into a level with minimum work by the level designer. 
                                    Being the main programmer in the project I wanted to focus most of my attention on building most of the mechanics in C++. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Being that it was designed from pinball, the paddles were the first thing I designed. 
                                    I wanted to make them as modular as possible, so I made a left and right paddle for both player 1 and 2.

                                            width="80%">
                                        </center>
                                        The most time-consuming class I had to make was my InputHadler class. 
                                        Since I had multiple different object that needed to be controlled at the same time, I had to come up with a solution to this. 
                                        My solution was at the start of the game was to iterate through the objects and store each paddle separately and when a designated key is pressed, I would call the correct paddles rotate function.

                                <h2 class="major">Challenges Face and What I learned</h2>
								<p>
                                    I learned a lot from this project, my biggest one was how to handle multiple inputs relatively easily. 
                                    While I learned a lot from it, it was my biggest challenge as well requiring many hours of tinkering and researching until I decided on what it is now. 
                                    The original goal was to have one iterator and store the paddles in an array, but the iteration and array just wouldn’t work how I wanted it to. 
                                    Other than the InputHandler, limiting myself to almost exclusively using C++ for the project while was useful information, ultimately reduced my efficiency. 
                                    I realized that I should start using both C++ and Blueprints in my future projects to better optimize my code along with my workload.
                                </p>
